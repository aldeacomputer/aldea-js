# AssemblyScript

Code deployed on the Aldea Computer is written in AssemblyScript, a language that is similar to TypeScript and compiles to WebAssembly. AssemblyScript has a JavaScript-like standard library with many of the same classes and namespaces.

## Why AssemblyScript?

AssemblyScript's similarity to JavaScript makes building on Aldea familiar and easy for many developers, lowering the barrier to entry and making Aldea one of the most intuitive and accessible blockchain platforms to build on.

Aldea's object-oriented approach to on-chain resources and smart contracts results in clear and readable code. The Aldea toolset is designed to help developers throughout the entire development lifecycle, prioritizing developers and creating an intuitive experience.

## Strictly typed

Unlike TypeScript or JavaScript, AssemblyScript is statically typed and compiled ahead of time, which means it cannot support some of JavaScript's more dynamic features. However, this is a benefit in the context of a blockchain because AssemblyScript's stricter type checking guarantees correctness in situations where TypeScript would not complain.

In addition, Aldea introduces some extra constraints to ensure that all code deployed on the Aldea Computer is secure and deterministic.
