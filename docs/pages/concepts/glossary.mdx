# Glossary

### ABI (application binary interface)

Document that describes how to interract with a package on the  Aldea Computer.

### Address

20-byte hash of a public key that is represented as a Bech32m encoded string.

### AssemblyScript

High-level programming language used to write Aldea code that compiles to WASM binary.

### Blake3

Fast and parallelizable cryptographic hash function.

### Block

Collection of transactions processed in a specific order. Blocks are proposed by proof-of-stake validators and shared across the network.

### Ed25519

Elliptic curve-based public-key system used to create private and public keys and for signing transactions.

### Hash

Digital fingerprint of variable-size input produced by a hash function.

### Instruction

Smallest unit of execution in a transaction. Instructions can load packages and Jigs, call methods and static functions, sign transactions, and deploy new packages.

### Jig

Fully programmable digital object. On Aldea, *everything is a Jig!*

### Origin

A Pointer derived from the the txid and output index from the transaction in which the Jig was initialised. Is a permanent reference to a Jig instance.

### Output id

32-bit hash of all the data of an output. It works as an identifier for the state of jigs in a given point of time.

### Output

New Jig instances and changes to existing instances committed in a transaction result in a new output.

### Package

Package of code deployed to the Aldea Computer in a transaction. A package can consist of one or more files and can export one or more classes or functions.

### Package ID

32-byte hash of the packaged source code that is unique and identifies a package by its contents.

### Pointer

36-byte data type comprised of a 32-byte ID plus a 4-byte index. Is used to locate a piece of data within a larger data structure.

### Public Key

256-bit number derived from the private key that can be shared publicly and used by anyone to verify digital signatures made with the corresponding private key.

### Private Key

Secret 256-bit number that allows Aldea users to control Jigs by signing transactions.

### Signature

64-byte Ed25519 signature used in transactions to cryptographically authorize changes to Jigs locked to a specific address.

### Transaction

A transaction is a list of instructions that are used to make changes to the state of a computer.

### WASM

Binary byte code that is designed to run quickly and efficiently. Packages written in AssemblyScript are compiled to WASM by an Aldea node.
