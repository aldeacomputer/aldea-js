# Transactions

All changes to the state of the Aldea Computer happen through transactions. A transaction is a list of instructions that are executed in order when the transaction is processed.

A block is a list of transactions that are processed in a specific order. When a chain of blocks is processed, all the instructions in the transactions are executed in order, resulting in a deterministic set of outcomes.

## Instructions

In Aldea, an instruction is a unit of code that performs a specific task. There are 11 different instructions that the Aldea computer can recognize and execute. These instructions can load Jigs and packages of code, call methods on Jigs or execute static functions, deploy new packages, and add signatures to transactions. Each instruction takes in a certain number of arguments and returns a result. Instructions can reference the result of previous instructions by using the index of the previous instruction.

For example, in the example below, the first instruction loads a Jig by its output ID, which can then be referred to by its index (0) in subsequent instructions. The second instruction accesses the Jig from the first instruction and calls the third method (index 2) from the Jig's application binary interface (ABI) and passed the CBOR encoded arguments to the method.

```ts
LOAD <OUTPUT_ID>
CALL 0 2 <CBOR_ENCODED_ARGS>
```

## Signatures

To update a Jig locked to an address in Aldea, a transaction must include one or more signatures. There are two instructions available for adding signatures to a transaction:

- `SIGN <SIGNATURE> <PUBKEY>`: This instruction adds a signature that signs every instruction in the transaction except for itself and other `SIGN` and `SIGNTO` instructions.
- `SIGNTO <SIGNATURE> <PUBKEY>`: This instruction adds a signature that signs every instruction **prior** to itself except for other `SIGN` and `SIGNTO` instructions.

## Outputs and packages

When a transaction is processed, the result of its instructions are split into two categories: outputs and packages.

Instructions that call methods and execute code that creates or updates Jigs result in **outputs**.

The `DEPLOY` instruction deploys a package of code to the blockchain. Packages export one or more classes or functions and are identified by their ID, which is a 32-byte hash of the package.

An output in Aldea has the following fields:

- `origin`: A 36-byte pointer referencing the transaction and output index where the Jig was first seen.
- `location`: A 36-byte pointer referencing the transaction and index of the current output.
- `class`: A 36-byte pointer referencing the package and export index of the class.
- `lock`: The lock type and data for the output.
- `state`: CBOR encoded state values for the output.

The output ID is generated by concatenating and hashing all of the output fields.
