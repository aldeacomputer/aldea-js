# MDX

With Nextra, all your `.md` and `.mdx` files under the pages directory will be rendered with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/about), it's an
advanced Markdown format with React component support.

You can use import and use React components inside your Markdown files like this:

```markdown
import Callout from 'nextra-theme-docs/callout'

**Markdown With React Components**

<Callout emoji="✅">
  **MDX** (the library), at its core, transforms MDX (the syntax) to JSX.
  It receives an MDX string and outputs a _JSX string_. It does this by parsing
  the MDX document to a syntax tree and then generates a JSX document from that tree. 
</Callout>
```

Generates:

import Callout from 'nextra-theme-docs/callout'

<div className="highlightContainer">

## Syntax Highlighting

Nextra syntax highlighting wasn't working properly, and given it's a known issue, I adapted our **CodeContainer** React component to be used as follows:

````markdown
<CodeContainer lang='js' >
    ```
    import useSWR from 'ssdwr'

    function Profile() {
      const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/user', fetcher)

      if (error) return <div>failed to load</div>
      if (!data) return <div>loading...</div>
      return <div>hello {data.name}!</div>
    }
    ```
</CodeContainer>
````

renders:

<CodeContainer lang='js' >
    ```
    import useSWR from 'ssdwr'

    function Profile() {
      const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/user', fetcher)

      if (error) return <div>failed to load</div>
      if (!data) return <div>loading...</div>
      return <div>hello {data.name}!</div>
    }
    ```
</CodeContainer>

See [Code Highlighting section](/advanced/code-highlighting) for more information on how to use it.


## Inline Code

You can use \`content\` to wrap inline code content like: `let x = 1`.

## Blockquote

> Where some people measure progress in answers-right per test or tests-passed per year, we are more interested in Sistine-Chapel-Ceilings per Lifetime.
>
> — Alan Kay, A Personal Computer for Children of All Ages

Nested quotes:

> > Where some people measure progress in answers-right per test or tests-passed per year, we are more interested in Sistine-Chapel-Ceilings per Lifetime.
> >
> > — Alan Kay, A Personal Computer for Children of All Ages
>
> This is **great**.
>
> — Shu Ding.

## Table

| Syntax        | Description |   Test Text |
| :------------ | :---------: | ----------: |
| Header        |    Title    | Here's this |
| Paragraph     |    Text     |    And more |
| Strikethrough |             |    ~~Text~~ |

## React Components

React components and Markdown can be **mixed together**, for instance:

```markdown
> <Callout>
>   Give [**Nextra**](https://github.com/shuding/nextra) a star!
> </Callout>
```

Renders:

> <Callout>
>   Give [**Nextra**](https://github.com/shuding/nextra) a star!
> </Callout>
