# Deploy your first package

In the previous step, you created a blank starter kit project, and created and topped up a new wallet. You're ready to start deploying some code.

## What is a package?

A package is a collection of files and exports, written in AssemblyScript, that can be deployed to the Aldea Computer. A package exports one or more classes or functions.

Classes that extend from the built-in `Jig` class have some magical properties. Instances of classes that inherit from `Jig` can be owned, locked, transferred and interacted with. Jigs are the fundamental building blocks of the Aldea Computer.

<CodeContainer lang="ts">
    ```
    export class Item extends Jig {
      name: string;
      power: u8;

      constructor(name: string) {
        super()
        this.name = name
        this.power = 1
      }

      addPower(val: u8): void {
        if (val < 1 || val > 10) {
          throw new Error('power can only be increased by 1-10')
        }
        this.power = min(this.power + val, 100)
      }
    }
    ```
</CodeContainer>

The example above can be found in your project at `aldea/item.ts`. The `Item` class has two typed propteries, `"name"` and `"power"`. The `"power"` propery defaults to `1` and can be increased by calling the `addPower()` method until it reaches the maximum of `100`.

It's a very simple example, but with a bit of imagination we can visualize a game where the player collects items and the player's power is the sum of all their items.

## Deploy a package

The CLI gives us a nice simple way to deploy a package. The following code will bundle our package, create a transaction and fund it with a coin in our wallet.

<CodeContainer lang="bash" lines={false}>
    ```
    npx aldea pkg.deploy item.ts
    ```
</CodeContainer>

The command prints a response containing some useful information.

- `txid` - The transaction ID.
- `pkg_id` - The ID of the deployed package. This is a content-addressable hash of the package source code, so will always be the same for identical packages.

**Keep a note of the package ID, we'll need it in the next step!**

## Next steps

You've just deployed your first package! That was pretty easy, right? If you're feeling adventurous, try making some changes to the `Item` class and deploying a new package.

When ready, move on to the next step where we'll build transactions to create and update `Item` instances.
