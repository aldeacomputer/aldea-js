# Create a new key pair

Every change to the state of the Aldea Computer happens through a transaction, and every transaction costs a fee. You need to own some Aldea to be able to commit transactions.

In the next few steps, we will generate a new KeyPair and use a faucet to transfer some coins to your private key. This will allow you to start working with your Aldea project.

## Generate new keys

Your starter kit project comes with a script that you can use to generate a new random key pair. To run the script, use the following command:

<CodeContainer lang="bash" lines={false}>
    ```
    npm run keygen
    ```
</CodeContainer>

This will create a new file called `.aldea` in your project. The file will contain your private key, public key, and address, like this:

<CodeContainer lang="text">
    ```
    PRIVKEY=1c0f2da803d2082fc3cbe479dae600395c6aa56935cb1f489b3707df3b1485f5
    PUBKEY=2c29e3cd0e323a5634dde254ed387e3066c0826d126a8ef1a8d34462adc3ea5a
    ADDRESS=aldea:1e0lnpaa8y8jpqhuq7t2c5m926nt2aqjzk26jzc
    ```
</CodeContainer>

The private key is a random 256-bit number, and the public key is derived from the private key using Ed25519 elliptic curve mathematics. The address is an encoded hash of the public key.

If you're curious, you can look at the source code in `scripts/keygen.js` to see how the keys are generated using the Aldea SDK. Here's what the code looks like:

<CodeContainer lang="ts">
    ```
    const keys = KeyPair.fromRandom()
    const address = Address.fromPubKey(keys.pubKey)
    ```
</CodeContainer>

## Use the faucet

Your project also comes with a script that you can use to receive freshly minted Aldea tokens to your new key pair. The `fund` command creates a new `Coin` instance and locks it to your address. To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
npm run fund
```

The script will return a JSON output that looks like this:

<CodeContainer lang="ts">
    ```
    {
      "id": "f1499fe3aa44403ed2e675d1abfe5e234358a82bf5a0ff66123c025df0829b5d",
      "origin": "1f994dc0a605006c737fbc373f87303e4dd026e595e316f61b26970473c29b5a_0",
      "location": "1f994dc0a605006c737fbc373f87303e4dd026e595e316f61b26970473c29b5a_0",
      "class": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000_0",
      "lock": { "type": 1, "data": "cbff30f7a721e4105f80f2d58a6caad4d6ae8242" },
      "state": "192710"
    }
    ```
</CodeContainer>

This is the JSON representation of an output. In this case, the output is an instance of a `Coin` Jig.

After running the script, you control the `Coin` and can use it to fund transactions. We'll talk more about that in the next chapter, but for now, copy and paste the JSON somewhere. You'll need the `id` and `origin` values in the next chapter.

  As we're working on a pre-alpha devnet, we can create Coin instances out of thin air. This won't be possible on the main network.
