# Install the starter kit

The Aldea Starter Kit is a simple way to set up an Aldea project and start writing and deploying code on the Aldea Computer blockchain.

To use it, you need to have a Node.js development environment with `npm` or `yarn` installed. In these examples, we'll use `npm`.

## Initialize an Aldea project

To create a new Aldea project, run the following command. It will create a directory called `demo-project` and set up a new Aldea project inside it.

<CodeContainer lang="bash" lines={false}>
    ```
    npm create aldea demo-project
    ```
</CodeContainer>

Once it's done, go into the directory and install the dependencies.

<CodeContainer lang="bash" lines={false}>
    ```
    cd demo-project && npm i
    ```
</CodeContainer>

You're now ready to start working on your Aldea project!

## Project structure

The generated project includes a few files and directories that you should know about. These are:

- `/aldea` - this directory contains the AssemblyScript code that you can deploy on the blockchain. It comes with some simple examples to get you started.
- `/scripts` - this directory contains JavaScript files with scripts that will help you create, deploy, and interact with the code on the blockchain.
