# Code Highlighting

`nextra-theme-docs` uses [Prism](https://prismjs.com) and [prism-react-renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer) 
to highlight the code blocks. However, this wasn't working properly and seems to be a known issue.highlight

That's why I adapted **CodeContainer** react component to be used as follows:

````markdown
<CodeContainer lang='js' >
    ```
    import useSWR from 'ssdwr'

    function Profile() {
      const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/user', fetcher)

      if (error) return <div>failed to load</div>
      if (!data) return <div>loading...</div>
      return <div>hello {data.name}!</div>
    }
    ```
</CodeContainer>
````

renders:

<CodeContainer lang='js' >
    ```
    import useSWR from 'ssdwr'

    function Profile() {
      const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/user', fetcher)

      if (error) return <div>failed to load</div>
      if (!data) return <div>loading...</div>
      return <div>hello {data.name}!</div>
    }
    ```
</CodeContainer>

Consider a fiew things:

 - Note that the component accepts a **lang** prop (js, rust, typescript and solidity are currently supported) and a **code markdown** child.
 - Don't forget to import it in your MDX file just as it's being done in this one: `import {CodeContainer} from '../../customComponents/codeContainer'`
 - This is also **indentation sensible**, so note how the code markdown has one level inside the react component.
 - There's also a **title** prop you can use that looks as follows:
 <CodeContainer lang='js' title='UseSWR.js' >
     ```
     import useSWR from 'ssdwr'

     function Profile() {
       const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/user', fetcher)

       if (error) return <div>failed to load</div>
       if (!data) return <div>loading...</div>
       return <div>hello {data.name}!</div>
     }
     ```
 </CodeContainer>
