The Aldea Starter Kit is an NPM initializer that will create a project structure for you, install the Aldea SDK and other dependencies, and provide a few scripts and examples for you to get started with.

## Usage

To use the starter kit, use the following command (replacing `my-project` with your own project name):

```shell
# using npm
npm create aldea@latest my-project

# or using yarn
yarn create aldea my-project
```

## Tutorial

Once setup, follow through the [walkthrough in the Aldea documentation](https://docs.aldeacomputer.com/getting-started/starter-kit) to begin deploying your own code and experimenting with the Aldea Computer.
