# Aldea Starter Kit

Aldea is a new layer 1 blockchain that offers developers of decentralized apps, games, and services an unparalleled experience on a platform designed for global scale.

The Aldea Starter Kit is an NPM initializer that will create an project structure for you, install the Aldea SDK and other dependencies, and provide a few scripts and examples for you to get started with.

**Warning**: Aldea is an early development. We are interating heavily on the design and function of the blockchain and expect frequent breaking changes. This software is not ready for general use.

## Usage

To use the starter kit with NPM, use the following command (replacing `my-project` with your own project name):

```shell
npm create aldea@latest my-project
```

With yarn:

```shell
yarn create aldea my-project
```

With PNPM:

```shell
pnpm create aldea my-project
```

## Tutorial

Once setup, follow through the [walkthrough in the Aldea documentation](https://docs.aldea.computer/getting-started/starter-kit) to begin deploying your own code and experimenting with the Aldea Computer.
