> The Aldea Computer virtual machine implemented in JavaScript.

The VM is really where all the magic happens. The JavaScript implementation currently serves as our reference implementation.

Developers won't usually have need to interract with the VM directly, but instead the VM is depended on by other packages such as the [mocknet](https://github.com/aldeacomputer/aldea-js/tree/main/packages/mocknet) or node implementations.
